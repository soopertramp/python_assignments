## :python: Daily Python Assignments
Welcome to the Daily Python Assignments repository! This initiative is designed to help you practice your Python skills and learn new techniques that are useful for data analysis and machine learning.

Each day, we'll post a new Python assignment that you can try to solve on your own. The assignments will start with basic concepts like printing "Hello World", and gradually progress to more advanced topics.
